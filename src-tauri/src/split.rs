//! Split-tunnel selection — shared by the xray config generator and the
//! OS-level per-app router (the helper).
//!
//! One `mode` applies to BOTH the apps and sites lists:
//!   - selective = whitelist (only listed apps/sites are tunneled; default direct)
//!   - general   = blacklist (everything is tunneled; listed entries are
//!     exceptions that stay direct)
//!
//! Both dimensions are enforced inside xray's routing: the app dimension via
//! xray's native Windows `process` matcher, the site dimension via `domain`
//! rules.
